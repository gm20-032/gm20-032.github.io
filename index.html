            <p>Cuboh is a company based out of Victoria, BC that integrates delivery apps into a restaurant's POS system and consolidates them into a single tablet to avoid tablet hell.
                
             <br><br>The current menu Scraper project was completed by last year's Capstone students.
                
                The application is a standalone web-app that takes a client's email and a link to a menu.
                
                It then generates a graded report of the menu and sends the client an email with the details of this report.
                
                <br><br>The main purpose of the application is to help generate leads for Cubohâ€™s team.

        </br><img src="images/docker.png" alt="Docker Logo"> </br>
            <p>Our first major milestone was dockerizing the front-end and back-end of the application.
                 Dockerization allows us to be able to pack and ship the application easily as a container, making it much easier for our team members to get our environments synced up and working. 
                 Dockerization will also make deployment much simpler for other developers in the future. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="point work2">
            <img src="images/django.png" alt="Django Logo"> 
            <p>Django and Flask are both web frameworks used to deploy web applications. We refactored the app to use Django instead of Flask. The switch was a little more difficult than initially expected, but we worked through it as a team. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="point work3">
            <img src="images/celery_logo.png" alt="Celery Logo">
            <p>Celery is like a task manager or queuing system that executes multiple concurrent processes. It is great for long runnings tasks like generating and sending a report. Another advantage of Celery over multithreading is its scalability.
